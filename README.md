This repository contains a simple shell script that demonstrates a common error when iterating over arrays of files in a loop. The script intends to process a list of files, but it contains an error in how it handles the array index. The `bug.sh` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.sh` provides the corrected version.  The error highlights the importance of correct array indexing in shell scripting to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure all files are processed as intended.
